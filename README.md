# Description
Budget Tracker is a progressive web application updated with offline access and functionality. Users can add expenses and deposits to their budget whether or not they are connected to the internet. If they go offline, their transactions will be updated once they regain connection. This application uses IndexedDb, service workers, and can also be downloaded as an app to the users home screen. Node.js, Mongoose.js, Express.js, MongoDb, morgan, and compression were used to build this app. Check out the live site hosted by heroku [here](https://evening-basin-48189.herokuapp.com/).
